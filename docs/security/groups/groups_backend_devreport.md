# Security → Groups — Backend Dev Report

> Screen: `/setup/security/groups` (Group Setup + Add/Edit Group). Built to match the
> legacy Denticon "Group Setup" UX in the app's own theme. Date: 2026-06-09.
> Verified against `openapi.json` (spec 1.0.0) and the generated Orval client.

## What the backend already supports

| Need | Endpoint | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| List groups | `GET /api/v1/user-groups` (`useListUserGroups`) | ✅ |
| Create group (name) | `POST /api/v1/user-groups` (`createUserGroup`) | ✅ |
| Rename / toggle group | `PATCH /api/v1/user-groups/{id}` (`updateUserGroup`) | ✅ |
| Delete group | `DELETE /api/v1/user-groups/{id}` (`deleteUserGroup`) | ✅ |

`UserGroup{Read,Create,Update}` model only `name`, `description`, `is_active` — **no access
rights**. So group CRUD (the left list, Add, Edit-name, Copy, Delete) is fully wired to the
backend; **the access-rights half of the screen has no contract** and is the gap below.

## Current frontend stop-gap

- The **rights catalog** (the "Available Rights" list — 517 distinct rights) is seeded from
  `dentc-backend/data/Groups.txt` into `src/data/groupRights.ts`. It is static; it should
  come from the backend.
- **Group → rights assignments** are persisted in **localStorage**
  (`src/features/groups/groupRightsStore.ts`), keyed by group id, so the screen is fully
  usable for review/testing. These do **not** sync across browsers/users and are **not**
  enforced anywhere.

## Missing API

### Gap 1 — Rights / permissions catalog

**Business requirement:** populate the "Available Rights" picker from the backend (one row
per assignable right), not a hardcoded file.

**Current status:** no endpoint. `GET /api/v1/roles` returns user *roles* (Option[]), which
is unrelated. (The backend's earlier note flagged `/permissions` as deferred Phase-4 RBAC.)

**Suggested endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/permissions` (or `/rights`) →
`[{ code: string, label: string, category: string }]`. ~517 rights across categories
(Appointments, Patient, Reports, Setup, Transactions, Utilities, …). Seed list available in
`src/data/groupRights.ts`.

**Impact:** until then the catalog is a static frontend file and can drift from the backend.

### Gap 2 — Group → rights assignment (read + write)

**Business requirement:** read the rights assigned to a group and save edits (the
"Assigned Rights" pane, plus "Save with Full Access").

**Current status:** no field on `UserGroup`, no endpoint.

**Suggested endpoints:**
- `GET /api/v1/user-groups/{id}/rights` → `string[]` (right codes), and/or include
  `right_codes: string[]` on `UserGroupRead`.
- `PUT /api/v1/user-groups/{id}/rights` with `{ right_codes: string[] }` (full replace,
  mirrors the office-users reconcile pattern). "Save with Full Access" = the full catalog.

**Expected request:** `{ "right_codes": ["appointments_add_new_appointment", …] }`
**Expected response:** the persisted `string[]`.

**Impact:** assignments currently live only in localStorage (stop-gap) — not shared, not
enforced. This is the core blocker for real RBAC.

### Gap 3 — Copy user group (server-side)

**Business requirement:** "Copy User Group" duplicates a group **with its rights**.

**Current status:** the frontend fakes it (create a `"<name> (copy)"` group, then copy the
local rights). With no backend rights store, the copy only duplicates the name server-side.

**Suggested endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/user-groups/{id}/copy` → new `UserGroupRead` with the
source group's rights reconciled. (Mirrors `POST /offices/{id}/users/copy-from/{source}`.)

### Gap 4 — Enforcement

Even once 1–3 land, assignments are **stored, not enforced**. Gating actions/screens by a
user's effective rights (via their group memberships) is a separate RBAC task — flagging so
it isn't assumed "done" when the assignment API ships.

## Also worth confirming
- **Right identity:** the frontend keys on a generated slug `code`. If the backend uses
  numeric right ids or its own codes, return them in the catalog so both sides agree.
- **Group ↔ user rollup:** users get rights via `user-group-memberships` (already exists).
  Confirm the intended precedence when a user is in multiple groups (additive, per legacy).
