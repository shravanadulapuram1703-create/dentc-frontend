This report is the hand-off for the backend team. Section 1 says how every field on
the four tabs is stored today; Section 2 lists what does **not** round-trip through
the API and what is needed; Section 3 lists the conventions the frontend adopted in
the meantime so migration is mechanical.

## 1. Field → storage map (what exists today)

### Tab 1 — PLAN

| Legacy field | Backend column | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Dental or Medical* | *(none on plan)* — derived from `insurance_carriers.carrier_type` / `is_dental` of the chosen carrier | ✅ works (carrier partition) |
| Plan Type* | `insurance_plans.plan_type` (free text) | ✅ saved; options from definitions `PLANTYPE` + legacy list |
| Group No.* | `insurance_plans.group_number` | ✅ saved; smart search via `GET /insurance-plans?search=` |
| Carrier* (+ ADD NEW, View Details) | `insurance_plans.carrier_id` | ✅ |
| Employer* (+ ADD NEW, View Details) | `insurance_plans.employer_id` (null = "No Employer") | ✅ |
| Anniversary (Month/Day)* | `insurance_plans.anniversary_date` (full date) | ✅ saved — see PLAN-DTL-3 |
| Fees to Print on Claims* | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 (browser-stored) |
| Claim Options* | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Form to Print* | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Reporting Subtype | **none** (options exist in definitions `PLANSUBTYPE`) | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Network Type | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Notice of Authorization (NOA) Only | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Per Visit Co-Pay | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Coverage Type / Prepaid / Active | `coverage_type`, `is_prepaid`, `is_active` | ✅ |

### Tab 2 — BENEFITS

| Legacy field | Backend column | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Individual Deductible | `individual_deductible` | ✅ |
| Family Deductible | `family_deductible` | ✅ |
| Individual Maximum | `individual_max` | ✅ |
| Family Maximum | `family_max` | ✅ |
| Individual Ortho Maximum | `ortho_max` | ✅ |
| Lifetime Ortho Benefits | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |
| Plan Notes | **none** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-1 |

### Tab 3 — COVERAGE & LIMITATIONS

Every row is one `insurance_coverage_rules` record (`ins_plan_id`-scoped).

| Legacy column | Backend column | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Category (header row) | `start_code = end_code = <legacy category code>` (`01`, `01A`, …), `category = "0"`, `description = label` | matches migrated data exactly |
| Exception (procedure code row) | `start_code = end_code = <ADA code>` (`D0120`), `category = <parent category code>`, `description = procedure description` | new convention (migrated data has no exception rows) |
| Ded. Waived | `ded_waived` | ✅ |
| Coverage (%) | `coverage_pct` | ✅ |
| Frequency Limitation | `freq_limit` = **1-based ordinal** into the legacy FREQUENCYLIMITATIONS list (`"0"`/null = No Limitation) | matches migrated data (verified on plans 52359/52360/52361) — see PLAN-DTL-4 |
| Age Limitation (Min) / (Max) | `age_limit` — **one** string column: `"min"` or `"min-max"` | ❌ PLAN-DTL-5 |
| Waiting Period (Months) | `wait_period` (string, months) | ✅ (string typed — PLAN-DTL-5) |
| "Change coverage table" | definitions `DEFCOVERAGE` (key1 = code, key2 = default %) and `GET /ins-custom-coverage` | ✅ |

### Tab 4 — FREQ LIMITATION CODE GRP

| Legacy column | Backend column | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Code Group | definitions `INSLIMITATIONS` (key1 = code, description = label) for the list; **no plan-level resource** | ❌ PLAN-DTL-2 |
| Frequency Limitation | — | ❌ PLAN-DTL-2 |
| Whole Mouth | — | ❌ PLAN-DTL-2 |
| Per Day Quantity | — | ❌ PLAN-DTL-2 |

## 2. Gaps

### 🔴 High — legacy data has nowhere to live

- **PLAN-DTL-1 — Nine plan-level fields have no column on `insurance_plans`.**
  `fees_to_print`, `claim_option`, `form_to_print`, `reporting_subtype`, `network_type`,
  `noa_only`, `per_visit_copay`, `lifetime_ortho_benefits`, `plan_notes`.
  The wizard captures them, stores them **per plan id in browser localStorage**
  (`dentc:ins_plan_extras:<plan_id>`, see `planExtrasStore.ts`) and labels them as
  not server-stored. They therefore do not follow the plan to another workstation
  or user, and Copy From Existing only copies them on the same browser.
  **Needed:** add the nine columns to `insurance_plans` (+ `InsurancePlanCreate/Update/Read`).
  Suggested types: `fees_to_print` / `claim_option` / `form_to_print` / `network_type`
  short varchar codes (frontend values in `planDetailsModel.ts`: `office_ucr|plan_fees|carrier_fees`,
  `submit|do_not_submit|print_only`, `ADA2024|ADA2019|ADA2012|ADA2006|CMS1500`,
  `unknown|in_network|out_of_network`), `reporting_subtype` varchar, `noa_only` bool,
  `per_visit_copay` numeric(10,2), `lifetime_ortho_benefits` bool, `plan_notes` text.
  Once they exist the frontend swap is one function (`splitPlanDetails` stops
  splitting; `planExtrasStore` is deleted).

- **PLAN-DTL-2 — No resource for per-plan frequency-limitation code groups.**
  Legacy "FREQ LIMITATION CODE GRP" rows (code group × frequency × whole-mouth × per-day
  quantity) have no table. To keep them **server-side and shared** the frontend persists
  them as `insurance_coverage_rules` rows under a reserved convention:

  | column | value |
  |---|---|
  | `category` | `"FREQGRP"` |
  | `start_code` = `end_code` | `"FQ" + <INSLIMITATIONS code>` (e.g. `FQ01`) |
  | `description` | code-group label |
  | `freq_limit` | frequency ordinal (as on Tab 3) |
  | `age_limit` | `"WM"` when Whole Mouth is ticked, else null |
  | `wait_period` | Per Day Quantity (string), null when blank |
  | `coverage_pct` | null |

  The estimate resolver (`src/services/coverageResolver.ts`) and the coverage tab
  exclude these rows, so they can't be mistaken for coverage. **Needed:** a real
  `plan_frequency_groups` table (`ins_plan_id`, `code_group`, `freq_limit`, `whole_mouth`,
  `per_day_quantity`) + CRUD endpoints; migrating is a `SELECT … WHERE category='FREQGRP'`.
  **Status 2026-09-07:** the backend shipped exactly this — `insurance-plan-frequency-groups`
  CRUD (`InsurancePlanFrequencyGroupRead`: `code_group`, `freq_limit`, `whole_mouth`,
  `per_day_quantity`) and a `frequency_groups` section on the bulk PUT. The wizard still writes
  the FREQGRP convention; migrating the tab onto the resource is the next step.

### 🟠 Medium — works, with a workaround worth removing

- **PLAN-DTL-3 — Anniversary is Month/Day in legacy but a full date on the backend.**
  `anniversary_date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`; the wizard preserves the stored year (or writes the
  current year on first save). Any backend logic that compares anniversary dates should
  compare month/day only, or the column should become `anniversary_month` + `anniversary_day`.

- **PLAN-DTL-4 — `freq_limit` is an undocumented ordinal.** Migrated rows store `"1"`,
  `"6"`, `"9"`, `"12"`… which are 1-based positions in the legacy FREQUENCYLIMITATIONS
  list (definitions `legacy_id` 325…337 → ordinals 1…13; `"0"` = No Limitation). Nothing in
  the API documents this and the definitions rows carry no ordinal (`sort_order` is null,
  `key1`/`key2` are the "Once"/"6" fragments). **Needed:** either an enum/lookup endpoint
  documenting the codes, or store the definition id / a `frequency_code` FK. Until then the
  frontend hardcodes the canonical 13 in `planDetailsModel.ts` (`FREQUENCY_FALLBACK`).
  **Status 2026-09-07:** `freq_limit` is now an `integer` on Create/Update/Read (bulk-PUT item
  docstring: "Frequency ordinal; 0/null = No Limitation") and `GET /insurance-plans/metadata`
  publishes `frequency_limitations[]` (`FrequencyLimitation`: `code` int + `label` +
  `definition_id`/`legacy_id`). The frontend converts at the request boundary
  (`freqLimitToApi`) and still uses `FREQUENCY_FALLBACK` for labels; switching to the
  metadata endpoint is a follow-up.

- **PLAN-DTL-5 — Coverage-rule limit columns are untyped strings.**
  `age_limit` is one string (legacy has Min **and** Max → the frontend encodes `"min-max"`),
  `wait_period` is a string (test data even contains `"10 days"`), `freq_limit` is a string.
  **Status 2026-09-07:** typed columns shipped — `age_min`, `age_max`, `wait_months`
  (integers) and integer `freq_limit`, with `age_limit`/`wait_period` kept as legacy string
  mirrors ("typed limits win over the legacy string mirrors"). Migrated rows still only carry
  the mirrors (typed columns `null` on tenant 1), so the frontend reads typed-when-present with
  a mirror fallback and writes both.
  **Needed:** `age_min int`, `age_max int`, `wait_months int`, `freq_limit int` (or the FK from
  PLAN-DTL-4). The wizard validates whole numbers so new rows are clean.

- **PLAN-DTL-6 — Definitions groups are duplicated ~5× in this tenant.**
  `DEFCOVERAGE` returns 140 rows for 28 distinct codes, `FREQUENCYLIMITATIONS` 65 for 13,
  `INSLIMITATIONS` 110 for 22, `PLANTYPE` 35 for 7, `PLANSUBTYPE` 50 for 10, `ADACATEGORIES`
  65 for 13. Every consumer has to de-duplicate (`planLookups.ts` does, on `key1` /
  `description`). Looks like the seed ran once per migration pass. **Needed:** dedupe the
  `definitions` table and add a unique constraint on `(tenant_id, group_code, key1, description)`.

- **PLAN-DTL-7 — `GET /insurance-plans?group_number=…` takes ~20 s.**
  The exact-match duplicate check the wizard runs on Finish (`planDuplicates.ts`) waits on
  this call; measured `20.2 s` for `group_number=QA-WIZ-0904` on 31k plans (the free-text
  `search=` variant returns in well under a second). The user sees a 20-second spinner on
  every save. **Needed:** an index on `insurance_plans (tenant_id, group_number)` and/or a
  cheap `HEAD`/count endpoint for "is this group taken" (also raised as INS-PT-20).

### 🟡 Low

- **PLAN-DTL-8 — No batch write for coverage rules.** A fresh plan is 28 category rows
  plus exceptions plus frequency groups, saved as ~30 sequential `POST
  /insurance-coverage-rules` calls (edits are diffed so only changed rows PATCH). A
  `PUT /insurance-plans/{id}/coverage-rules` bulk replace would make Finish atomic; today
  a mid-way failure leaves a partial table (the wizard reports per-row failures).
  **Status 2026-09-07:** shipped — `GET`/`PUT /insurance-plans/{plan_id}/coverage-rules`
  (`PlanCoverageReplaceRequest` with `rules` + `frequency_groups`, items with `id` update in
  place, unmentioned rows deleted, one transaction). Not wired yet; the wizard still diff-saves
  row by row.

- **PLAN-DTL-9 — No `updated_at` / `updated_by` on plans or coverage rules.**
  `InsurancePlanRead` and `InsuranceCoverageRuleRead` expose only `created_at`, so the
  legacy "Modified On/By" cannot be shown (same family as INS-PT-8).
  **Status 2026-09-07:** `InsuranceCoverageRuleRead` now carries `created_by`, `updated_by`,
  `updated_at`. Plans unchanged.

## 3. Conventions the frontend relies on (for migration)

1. **Category rows**: `start_code = end_code = <category code>`, `category = "0"`. Matches
   the 28-row migrated default table exactly (`01 … 12`, `01A … 11B`).
2. **Exception rows**: `start_code = end_code = <ADA code>` (`D\d{4}`), `category = <parent
   category code>` — the estimate resolver honours ADA-keyed rows *first*, then falls back to
   the category rows (`coverageResolver.resolveCoverage`).
3. **Frequency ordinal** (PLAN-DTL-4) and **age min-max** encoding (PLAN-DTL-5) as above.
4. **FREQGRP** rows (PLAN-DTL-2) as above; excluded from coverage everywhere by
   `category === "FREQGRP" || start_code startsWith "FQ"`.
5. **Default coverage table**: definitions `DEFCOVERAGE` `key2` = default %; default
   frequencies come from the migrated legacy table (identical on every migrated plan checked):
   `01→1, 01A→6, 01B→9, 01D→5, 02→1, 02A→12, 03→6, 03A→9, 03B→9, 04→12, 04A→12, 05→7, 06→12,
   06A→12, 09→12, 09A→9`, all others `0`.
6. **Browser-stored extras** (PLAN-DTL-1): `localStorage["dentc:ins_plan_extras:<plan_id>"]`
   JSON with the nine snake_case keys above.

## 4. Live verification log (2026-09-04)

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| Open Setup → Plans with `?plan_id=52360` (migrated plan) | wizard opens in edit mode; Coverage tab shows the legacy values exactly as the reference screenshot (Diagnostic = Once every 6 months, X-Rays = Once per Benefit Year, Panoramic = Once per Five Benefit Years, PAs = No Limitation, Bitewings = Four per Benefit Year) |
| Add Plan → PLAN (PPO, `QA-WIZ-0904`, CIGNA (PPO), No Employer) → BENEFITS (50/150/1500/3000/1000, note) → COVERAGE (default table + `D0120` exception at 90 %, Twice per Benefit Year) → FREQ (group `01`, Once per Benefit Year, qty 2) → Finish | `POST /insurance-plans` → **#89895**; `30` coverage-rule rows created (28 categories, `D0120` with `category=01`, `FQ01` with `category=FREQGRP`, `freq_limit=6`, `wait_period=2`) |
| Re-open #89895 via deep link, tick Whole Mouth on the FQ01 row, Finish | diff-save PATCHes only the changed row (`age_limit → "WM"`), other 29 rows untouched |
| Probe `POST` of a FREQGRP-shaped row on plan 89894 | accepted (201) and deleted again (204) — convention is storable |
