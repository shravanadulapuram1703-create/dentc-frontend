# Periodontal Charting — Backend Dev Report (hand-off to backend team)

**Module:** Patient → Perio Chart · Frontend: `src/features/perio/**` · Route `/patient/:patientId/perio`.
**Purpose:** This document is the authoritative backend gap report for the Periodontal Charting
module. The frontend is fully built and live-verified; this lists what the backend already
supports end-to-end and the concrete changes needed to make the remaining features persist
correctly. IDs `PERIO-BE-*` are stable — please reference them in tickets/PRs.

**How this was verified (2026-06-23):** Live OpenAPI spec pulled from the running backend
(`GET http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/openapi.json`, spec v1.0.0, 267 paths) + live API calls
(login as `udayk`, patient `83867`, exam `2847`) to probe constraints/behaviors. Every claim
below was observed against the live backend, not inferred.

## 3. Confirmed working — please do NOT regress these

- Full CRUD on all 5 resources; pagination/sort/search on every list.
- `perio-exams` filter by `patient_id`; `perio-exam-details` filter by `exam_id` **and** `tooth_no`.
- All 6 sites for PD/FGM/MGJ/furcation + buccal/lingual mobility persist (integers).
- **FGM accepts negative integers** (verified `fgm1:-3` → 200) — needed for the coronal-margin "+N" keypad.
- Bleeding/Suppuration booleans persist.
- Referential integrity: a detail with a non-existent `exam_id` is rejected (verified → **409**).
- Exam `notes` (free text) and `is_voided` persist.

## 4. Gaps & requested backend changes (prioritized)

### Priority 1 — data integrity / correctness

**PERIO-BE-1 — Add a UNIQUE constraint on `perio_exam_details(exam_id, tooth_no)`.**
- Evidence: `POST /perio-exam-details {exam_id:2847,tooth_no:"4",…}` succeeds even when a row for tooth 4 already exists → created a duplicate (`id 78325`).
- Impact: a chart can hold two contradictory rows for the same tooth/exam; the frontend currently has to guard against this with an in-memory id map, and concurrent saves can still duplicate.
- Ask: add the unique constraint **and** (ideally) an upsert path — see PERIO-BE-8.

**PERIO-BE-2 — Mobility columns must accept decimals.**
- Evidence: `PATCH {mobility_buccal:0.5}` → **422**; `{mobility_buccal:2}` → 200. Columns are INTEGER.
- Impact: the legacy Mobility keypad uses half-grades (0.5 / 1.5 / 2.5); these cannot be stored. Frontend shows them but drops non-integers on save.
- Ask: change `mobility_buccal`, `mobility_lingual` to `NUMERIC(2,1)` (or `float`). (Optionally apply the same to PD/FGM/MGJ if half-mm probing is ever needed — not required today.)

**PERIO-BE-3 — Make DELETE semantics consistent; let the exam list exclude voided.**
- Evidence: `DELETE /perio-exams/2848` returned 204 but the row **still appears** in the list with `is_voided=true` (soft delete). `DELETE /perio-exam-details/{id}` **hard-deletes** (rows disappear). Inconsistent.
- Impact: "Delete Exam" doesn't actually remove the exam; voided/deleted exams keep showing in the Date-of-Service dropdown because the list has no way to exclude them.
- Ask: (a) decide soft vs hard per resource and document it; (b) add an `is_voided` (or `include_voided`) filter to `GET /perio-exams`, defaulting to exclude voided; or have the list exclude voided by default.

### Priority 2 — missing clinical data / fidelity

**PERIO-BE-4 — CAL is not stored (no `cal1..6`).**
- Today CAL is derived client-side as `PD + FGM`. That's fine when both are charted, but CAL cannot be entered or stored independently (e.g., direct CAL recording, or CAL without FGM).
- Ask: either add `cal1..6` (integer/decimal) to `perio_exam_details`, **or** confirm in the contract that CAL is always derived = PD + FGM so the frontend can rely on that permanently.

**PERIO-BE-5 — `perio_exam_details` has no audit columns.**
- Read schema exposes only `id` (+ measurements/exam_id/tooth_no): no `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`.
- Impact: can't show per-tooth "last modified by/on", and can't audit who changed a probing value.
- Ask: add `created_at`, `updated_at`, `created_by`, `updated_by`.

**PERIO-BE-6 — Exam attribution is thin.**
- `PerioExam.created_by` is an integer user id (no resolved name); there is no `updated_by`/`updated_at`.
- Impact: the chart can't show "Charted by <name> on <date>" or "Last edited by …" without a separate user lookup.
- Ask: add `updated_at`/`updated_by` to `perio_exams`, and expose `created_by_name`/`updated_by_name` (or embed a minimal user object) on the read model.

**PERIO-BE-7 — No server-side value range validation.**
- Evidence: `PATCH {pd1:999}` and `{furc1:9}` both succeeded (200).
- Impact: out-of-range/garbage values can be stored via the API. The frontend keypads limit input, but the API is open.
- Ask: validate clinical ranges server-side, e.g. PD/CAL 0–20, FGM −10…+10, furcation 0–4, mobility 0–3 (post BE-2).

### Priority 3 — efficiency / convenience / future

**PERIO-BE-8 — Provide a bulk upsert for exam details.**
- Saving a full chart is up to ~32 individual POST/PATCH calls and is not atomic.
- Ask: a bulk/upsert endpoint, e.g. `PUT /perio-exams/{id}/details` taking an array keyed by `tooth_no` (insert-or-update). Naturally enforces one-row-per-tooth (BE-1) and is atomic.

**PERIO-BE-9 — Add date-range filters to `GET /perio-exams`.**
- Only `patient_id` is filterable; Compare-by-Dates and history fetch all exams and filter client-side.
- Ask: add `date_from`/`date_to` (and the `is_voided` filter from BE-3).

**PERIO-BE-10 — (Optional) Server-side comparison / summary / print.**
- Compare-by-Dates aggregation and the PDF/print are client-side. The **Periodontal Examination
  Record** print now ships in the frontend (`src/features/perio/perioPrint.ts`, toolbar → Print),
  rendered with jsPDF from the same in-memory chart the grid draws — so this is no longer blocking.
- Ask (nice-to-have): a comparison/summary endpoint (pocket-depth deltas across exams) and/or a print/report payload.

**PERIO-BE-11 — Per-user chart settings convenience + defaults.**
- `/perio-chart-settings` requires filtering by `user_id` (client must know its own id) and ships no seeded default row, so the frontend currently keeps prefs in `localStorage` instead.
- Ask: `GET /perio-chart-settings/me` (resolve current user from the token) and seed a default row on first access, so prefs round-trip server-side.

**PERIO-BE-12 — Define the `auto_advance` JSON schema on templates.**
- `PerioChartTemplate.auto_advance` is a free-form `object` with no documented shape; the frontend can't honor template-driven probing order and uses a fixed order.
- Ask: define and document the `auto_advance` structure (site visiting order per arch/surface).

**PERIO-BE-14 — `PerioExam` has no provider.**
- The legacy Denticon report prints a **Provider** block (name, address, Tax ID, License#) beside the
  patient, but `PerioExam` carries only `patient_id`/`office_id` and `created_by` (a *user*, not a
  provider).
- **Frontend workaround (in place):** the Perio Chart toolbar now has a **Provider** picker; the
  selection is what prints. It is seeded from the patient's `preferred_provider_id`, falling back to
  the office's `billing_provider_id`, and — because there is nowhere on the exam to put it — is
  persisted **per exam in `localStorage`** (`perio:exam_provider`, see `perioService.ts`). That means
  the provider on a reprint is only correct on the machine that charted it; another workstation, a
  cleared profile, or a different user reprinting the same exam falls back to the inferred default.
- Impact: the sheet is attached to insurance claims, where the rendering provider must be accurate.
- Ask: add a nullable `provider_id` (FK → `providers`) to `PerioExam` create/read/update, and ideally a
  resolved `provider_name` on the read model (same treatment as `created_by_name` from BE-6). Once it
  lands, the frontend deletes the `localStorage` seam — ping this module's owner.

**PERIO-BE-13 — Clarify or deprecate `PerioChartActivity`.**
- This denormalized legacy log (`perio_type`/`orientation`/`arch`/`quadrant`/`block_no`/`mxy`/`perio_value`, `created_by` as a **string**) has no documented relationship to exams/details and is unused by the new UI.
- Ask: confirm whether it must be populated/kept in sync with exams+details, or mark it deprecated/migration-only.

## 5. Notes for the backend team
- Tenant scoping is via the `X-Tenant-ID` header (templates list has no tenant query param) — consistent with other modules.
- Once BE-1/BE-2/BE-8 land, the frontend can drop its client-side duplicate guard and decimal-skip workaround (tracked in `src/features/perio/perioModel.ts` `detailBody` and `PerioChart.tsx` `idByTooth`). Ping the frontend (this module owner) to remove those after the backend ships.
